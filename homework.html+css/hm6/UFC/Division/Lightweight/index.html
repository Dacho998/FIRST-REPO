    <h1>Lightweight Division</h1>
    <p>The lightweight division in mixed martial arts contains different weight classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The UFC's lightweight division, which groups competitors within 146 to 155 lb (66 to 70 kg)
        </li>
        <li>The Shooto lightweight division, which limits competitors to 145 lb (65.8 kg)</li>
        <li>The ONE Championship's lightweight division, with an upper limit at 77.1 kg (170.0 lb)</li>
        <li>The Road FC's lightweight division, with an upper limit at 154 lb (70 kg)</li>
    </ul>
    For the sake of uniformity, most American mixed martial arts media outlets consider <br> Lightweight competitors to
    be
    between 146 and 155 lb (66 and 70 kg). This encompasses The Shooto Welterweight division (154 lb / 70 kg).
    The UFC's lightweight division was reinstated at UFC 58 after falling into disuse following UFC 49. <br> Sean Sherk, a
    former welterweight contender, defeated Kenny Florian at UFC 64, <br> becoming the first UFC lightweight champion since
    2002. <br>
    The lightweight limit, as defined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and the Association of Boxing Commissions is 155 lb (70 kg).
