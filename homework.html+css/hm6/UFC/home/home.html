            <h3>History</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting in 1993 as a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, UFC has revolutionized the
                fight business and today stands as a premium global sports brand,<br> media content company and the
                largest
                Pay-Per-View (PPV) event provider in the world.

            <li>UFC follows a rich history and tradition of
                competitive MMA dating back to Pankration,<br> a Greek Olympic Games event introduced in 648 BC. About
                80
                years ago, a Brazilian form of MMA known as Vale Tudo <br> (anything goes) sparked local interest in the
                sport. UFC then introduced organized and sanctioned MMA to the United States.</li> <br>
                
            <li>The goal was to find “the Ultimate Fighting Champion” by staging a single-night tournament featuring the
                best athletes skilled in the various disciplines of all martial arts, <br> including karate, jiu-jitsu,
                boxing, kickboxing, grappling, wrestling, sumo and other combat sports. <br> The winner of the
                tournament
                would be crowned the champion. </li><br>
                
            <li>Throughout the years, UFC has consistently strived for the highest
                levels of safety and quality in all aspects of the sport. <br> The organization has sought to break down
                gender stereotypes and set new standards for athlete health and wellness and was the first <br> combat
                sports
                organization to provide its athletes with accident insurance coverage for training-related injuries.
            </li><br>
            </li>
            <li>Beginning July 2015, UFC introduced the first-ever Athlete Outfitting Policy and UFC Fight Kit. <br>The
                branded apparel created in partnership with Reebok, UFC’s exclusive worldwide outfitter, <br> was
                introduced
                to elevate the brand’s look and feel and provide athletes with high quality gear specifically developed
                for MMA athletes.</li> <br>
            <li>In February 2016, UFC announced a five-year extension of its partnership with Cleveland Clinic, along
                with a one million-dollar contribution, <br> to continue its support of the Professional Fighters Brain
                Health Study. <br>The study is focused on developing methods to detect the earliest and most subtle
                signs of
                brain injury in athletes exposed to head trauma, <br> as well as determining which individuals may be
                more
                likely to develop chronic neurological disorders.</li> <br>
            <li>In August 2016, UFC was acquired by global sports, entertainment and fashion leader, Endeavor, together
                with strategic partners Silver Lake Partners and KKR, <br> making history as the largest-ever financial
                acquisition of a sports property.</li>
